## Why This App is Helpful

This application is especially valuable for individuals interested in video editing or content creation. By providing separate audio and video files, it enables video editors and Canva artists to work more efficiently. Having separate files allows for easier manipulation and editing, which is crucial for those looking to create professional-quality content.

For educational purposes, this app allows users to analyze and learn from YouTube videos by isolating audio or video components. This can be particularly useful for tutorials, interviews, and other content where the audio or visual elements need to be studied independently.
